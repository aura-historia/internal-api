## 2025-09-30 - Watchlist Feature

### Added

Three new endpoints have been added to support the user item watchlist feature:

#### New Endpoints

1. **GET /api/v1/watchlist**
   - Retrieves all items in the authenticated user's watchlist
   - Uses cursor-based pagination with RFC3339 timestamps (search-after pattern)
   - Supports sorting by creation date (when item was added to watchlist)
   - Supports language selection via `Accept-Language` header
   - Supports currency selection via `currency` query parameter
   - Returns items with full item details and the timestamp when added to watchlist
   - **Authentication**: Required (Cognito JWT)
   - **Query Parameters**:
     - `currency` (optional): Currency for price display (default: EUR)
     - `sort` (optional): Field to sort by (only `created` supported)
     - `order` (optional): Sort order `asc` or `desc`
     - `from` (optional): RFC3339 timestamp cursor for pagination
     - `size` (optional): Number of items per page (min: 1, max: 100, default: 21)
   - **Headers**:
     - `Accept-Language` (optional): Language for localized content (de, en, fr, es)
     - `Authorization` (required): Cognito JWT Bearer token

2. **POST /api/v1/watchlist**
   - Adds an item to the authenticated user's watchlist
   - Request body must contain `shopId` and `shopsItemId`
   - Returns 201 Created with `Location` header pointing to the resource
   - **Authentication**: Required (Cognito JWT)
   - **Request Body**: `ItemKeyData` (shopId, shopsItemId)
   - **Headers**:
     - `Authorization` (required): Cognito JWT Bearer token

3. **DELETE /api/v1/watchlist/{shopId}/{shopsItemId}**
   - Removes a specific item from the authenticated user's watchlist
   - Requires the `created` timestamp as a query parameter to identify the exact entry
   - Returns 204 No Content on success
   - **Authentication**: Required (Cognito JWT)
   - **Path Parameters**:
     - `shopId` (required): UUID of the shop
     - `shopsItemId` (required): Shop's item identifier
   - **Query Parameters**:
     - `created` (required): RFC3339 timestamp of when the watchlist entry was created
   - **Headers**:
     - `Authorization` (required): Cognito JWT Bearer token

#### New Data Types

1. **ItemKeyData**
   - Object identifying an item by shop ID and shop's item ID
   - Properties:
     - `shopId` (string, uuid, required): Shop identifier
     - `shopsItemId` (string, required): Shop's item identifier

2. **WatchlistItemData**
   - Object representing a watchlist entry
   - Properties:
     - `item` (GetItemData, required): Full item details
     - `created` (string, date-time, required): RFC3339 timestamp when added to watchlist

3. **WatchlistCollectionData**
   - Paginated collection of watchlist items using cursor-based pagination
   - Properties:
     - `items` (array of WatchlistItemData, required): Watchlist items in current page
     - `pagination` (PaginationDataDateTime, required): Pagination metadata

4. **PaginationDataDateTime**
   - Pagination metadata for cursor-based pagination using timestamps
   - Properties:
     - `from` (string, date-time, required): Starting cursor timestamp
     - `size` (integer, required): Number of items in current page
     - `total` (integer, optional, nullable): Total count (may not be available)
     - `next` (string, date-time, optional, nullable): Next page cursor

5. **SortWatchlistItemFieldData**
   - Enum for watchlist sorting fields
   - Values: `created`

#### New Error Codes

- `INVALID_RFC3339_TIMESTAMP`: Returned when an RFC3339 timestamp parameter is malformed
- `WATCHLIST_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND`: Returned when attempting to delete a non-existent watchlist entry

### Changed

#### Generalized type `UnprocessedPutItem`
- The type `UnprocessedPutItem` has been generalized to `ItemKeyData`. It's a composite key for identifying an item.
- `UnprocessedPutItem` therefore no longer exists. `ItemKeyData` is used now. Their payload does **not** differ.

#### Pagination Pattern
- Watchlist endpoints use cursor-based pagination with RFC3339 timestamps instead of offset-based pagination
- The `from` query parameter accepts an RFC3339 timestamp
- The response includes a `next` field in pagination metadata when more results are available
- The `total` field in pagination metadata is optional for cursor-based pagination
- The other endpoints using pagination are unaffected and still rely on Offset/Limit-Pagination.

### Removed

No endpoints or features have been removed in this update.
